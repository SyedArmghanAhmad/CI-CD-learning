# CI/CD Learning Repository

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing end-to-end CI/CD pipelines using modern DevOps tools and technologies.

## Technologies Covered
- **Jenkins**: For building and automating CI/CD pipelines
- **ArgoCD**: For GitOps continuous delivery
- **AWS**: Cloud infrastructure and services
- **Docker**: Containerization and image management

## Learning Objectives
1. Set up complete CI/CD pipelines from development to production
2. Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) practices
3. Automate build, test, and deployment processes
4. Learn GitOps principles with ArgoCD
5. Work with containerized applications in pipelines
